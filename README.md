# WordleAI

**Configuration and Instructions to Run:**

1. Update path in Easy.py on line 6 to the path Absolute Path to the directory of the project.
2. Check server.js line 7. It calls the python script as if it were from command line, so make sure 'python' is how it would be called on your machine. (Some users use 'python3' instead).
3. Make sure that node.js is installed on your machine. If you do not have it installed, visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to download.
4. Call the following command from your Terminal: 'node server.js' to launch the server. It opens a localhost server on port 8889. Visit it here http://localhost:8889 after you launch the server.
5. Have fun playing WordleAI!
