**Instructions on How To Run**
1. Make sure node.js is installed on your machine. Otherwise, install here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine. Otherwise, install here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Install express.js. In your terminal, enter 'npm install express'

4. Check how python is run from your terminal. If you use 'python3' to execute python scripts, move on to Step 5. Otherwise, update lines 26, 31, and 36 in server.js. Change 'python3' to whatever command you use to run python scripts. For example, most users change it to 'python' or 'py'.

5. Launch the Express server by entering 'node server.js' from the terminal. **Make sure you are in the WordleAI directory.** This will launch the application on port 8889. We recommend using Chrome, however it also works on Safari. Visit http://localhost:8889/ once the server is started to play the game.

6. Enjoy playing our game!
